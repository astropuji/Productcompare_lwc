# LWC Components

## Supported Browsers

These browsers take full advantage of Lightning Web Components performance enhancements:

| Browser Name | Version |
 --- | --- |
| Google Chrome™ | 59 |
| Microsoft® Edge | 15 |
| Mozilla® Firefox® | 54 |
| Apple® Safari® | 11 |

For earlier versions of these browsers, and for other browsers, the framework uses compatibility mode. Compatibility mode uses the lowest common denominator—the framework transpiles down to ES5 and adds the required polyfills. Not all modern Web APIs are available by default.

Running in compatibility mode affects performance. For example, Lightning Web Components work correctly in Safari 9 and Microsoft® Internet Explorer® 11, but they miss framework optimizations, don’t perform as well, and not all modern Web APIs are available.
